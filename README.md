Detailed instructions will be presented in the releases.

``` git clone https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-dev-box.git```

``` cd phase-0-dev-box ```

``` vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest```

``` vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-chef-nochef```

``` vagrant up```

``` vagrant ssh```

``` cd /vagrant```

``` exit ```

## Release 0: Install prerequisite programs

  - Vagrant [VagrantUp](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  - VirtualBox [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

In the terminal type:
``` cd Desktop```

``` git clone https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-dev-box.git```

`cd phase-0-dev-box`

## Release 2: Install Vagrant Plugins

```


on this step, run this command ``` vagrant plugin uninstall ffi && vagrant plugin install ffi --plugin-version 1.9.8```,

otherwise you can continue to the next release.

## Release 4: Connect to Vagrant
Type this command to connect to your VM:

``` vagrant ssh```

To find the shared folder between the VM and your home operating system, change your directory to /vagrant:

``` cd /vagrant```

Now you are using Linux!

## Release 5: Test for completion

``` ruby -v``` should output 2.2.1

``` rspec -v``` should output 3.1.5

``` sqlite3 --version``` should output 3.8.7

``` git --version``` should output 2.2.1

## Workflow
In order to use this environment, you will need to make sure you clone your Devbootcamp repositories into this repository. 

1. Clone the unit repo into the phase-0-dev-box

2. Connect to the vagrant box (in your command line) using ``` vagrant ssh```

3. Open the repository in Sublime Text

4. Change directories using ``` cd /vagrant```
<!--do they always need to do this to change directories here? It might be good to specify that -->

5. Edit the files in Sublime, then run them as instructed in the command line
